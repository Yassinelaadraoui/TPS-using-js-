<h1> Travelling Sales person algorithm</h1>

This is my take on the popular TSP algorithm, the code starts with the drawing 3 random dots on the canvas and then it goes to start drawing lines using a formula till it finds the shortest path between the 3 points, the number of points can be increased but the period it takes to calculate the path also increases which one of the problems with TSP, i used here the most optimal formula to get the results in the shortest period of time.
